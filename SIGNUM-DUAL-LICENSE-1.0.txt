
SIGNUM DUAL LICENSE 1.0

Signum Dual License (SDL) is a dual license for software libraries based on GNU General Public License (GPLv3) for non-profit software projects, and Signum Open Business License (SOBL) for any commercial project. 

It is considered a commercial project: 

 • Any software that is running in-house in a for-profit company.
 • Any for-profit website made public.
 • Any project sold by an independent software vendor.

Any non-profit project not included in those categories is governed by GNU General Public License (GPLv3)
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)

Any project under those categories is governed by the Signum Open Commercial License 1.0 (below)


SIGNUM OPEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE 1.0

Signum Open Commercial License is an open source commercial license for software libraries that requires a Usage License to make a Production Usage of a software project based on these libraries. 

1. Glossary:

 • “Subscription period”: A renewable, one year long period of time as specified in the Usage License.
 • “Signum-based Project”: Cohesive software codebase that makes use of any software library under the Signum Dual License.
 • “Code version”: A particular set of code in a source repository (i.e.: a git commit) with a date and an author. 
 • “Production usage”: The act of using a Signum-based project with a for-profit aim. 
 • “Licensable module”: Set of code files and software assets that can be licensed independently. 
 • “Licensable modules definition”: A document that relates a Licensable module with a set of classes and other software assets. This document should be included in any software library under the Signum Dual License, along with the present document. 

 
2. Open Source Rights: 

Any software library under the Signum Dual License can be distributed and modified without the need of any Usage License. Seamlessly, the software library can also be used in a Signum-based Project as long as it’s not considered a Production usage. (i.e.: can be used in Prototypes, Development and Tests environments) 

3. Usage License Rights: 

A Usage License is a document that defines:

 • A set of licensed modules 
 • A Subscription Period
 • A Project Name

A Usage License lets the holder make a Production Usage of one Signum-base Project, for an unlimited amount of time as long as the project:

 • Does not make use of any Licensable Module not include in the Usage License. Any use of a class or other software asset included in the “Licensable modules definition” is considered a use of the corresponding Licensable Module.  
 
 • Does not include a Code Version newer than the end of the Subscription Period which author is a Signum Software developer, identified by a Signum Software email address. It’s not necessary to renew the Usage License in order to continue making a Production Usage of the Signum-based Project with older Code Versions. But it’s necessary in order to include newer Code Versions from Signum Software developers.
